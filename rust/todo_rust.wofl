* using std::mem::zeroed() in cases where None is expected in structs would break programs assuming None is 0
  * swap enum variants in the declaration of Option in rust itself
    * recompile rust
      * did it work? anything broke?
      * try its tests
        * find out how to run its tests
    * use that rust for an example project
      * try 'way2' comment (instead of 'way1') in this:
        \ https://github.com/correabuscar/sandbox/commit/74f08d4ce78db24b436e7a265f29800eff7d66a3#diff-badd165b4a546a5cc9f5b275f3e718239123d96ee08e6a4dfbe0857f610b788fR80-R96
      * did it work with that rust?
        \ it should not have because 0(that mem::zeroed()) isn't None, 1 is None now

* rust's global allocator could detect if any alloc was done while within a fork-ed process
  \ or worst case, my own custom allocator would do that in my own program.
  \ but I meant here, my own local copy of rust compiler would do this check(s).
  * first save current process id somewhere before main() gets called
    \ TODO: what if #[no_main] 
    * this assumes no alloc from rust can be done before main() gets called
      \ TODO: is this a true assumption?
      * what if from within non-rust happens?
        \ for fork purposes this doesn't matter, we assume fork() can't be called before main()
        * unless fork() can be called before main() somehow
          \ TODO: see if it can or can't
  * on each alloc, check if current pid is different, then this is the forked process
    \ TODO: unless there's some way to change current pid, then this won't work to detect forks
  * so if in forked process doing an alloc, panic with proper msg (allocs no good in fork-ed process)
    \ https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81858/files#diff-256489a401631296d6aebb6537ff78cde5cf3c0188004e6d2c479f7cbbc156d2R471-R472

* use the same is it a fork detection mechanism within the panic rust_panic_with_hook() within rustc
  * and thus only abort(in fork) instead of printing user-formatted msg or a stacktrace
    \ https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/122940#issuecomment-2016911490
  * ensure other things like thread locals aren't used within the fork
    \ not sure how, atm.
    \ or maybe they are safe? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/122940#issuecomment-2016750887
    \ see prev. comments which might've thought they aren't - investigate if they really are or aren't (still uncertain at this time)

* cargo test doesn't properly catch tests that exit() or abort, etc.
  \ only those that panic, but not double panic(which aborts) are caught
  \ curiously (and I haven't explored why) --test-threads=1 mostly works (output of the name of the current test aka which test failed is still on screen after it fails, unlike --test-threads=2+)
  \ I'm already using libtest's catch_unwind() and set_hook (panic handler) and atexit and now sig handler for abort and also for ctrl+c(todo)
  \ current patch name which is a WIP(work in progress) is: cargo_test-threads_loses_output.patch
  * ensure tests are caught in these cases too:
    * test aborts (SIGABRT aka 6) - use sig handler
    * test panics recursively until stack overflown
    * test panics(once, twice, or recursively) or even aborts, in some weird places
      * in global allocator
      * in Drop (drop)
      * in Display impl during a panic
    * ensure combinations of the above are also tested against
      \ or are they already covered in the above, hmm... can't think atm.
    * ensure panics in the implementation of handling the above cases are still handled
      \ like a panic while accessing some atomic or thread local whose purpose was to guard against recursive panics (for example)
    * what happens if I've my own panic handler (aside from the one that libtest will have after I'm done with the above)
      \ so from within my own test(s)
      * i panic within my panic handler
      * i return from it
      * i abort from it
      * some infinite panic recursion happens within my panic handler eg. in Display impl, or Drop, or global allocator
    * what happens with those #[should_panic] tests
    * what if panic is non-unwinding panic
      \ unsure if it matters here, it's still a kind that abort()s, so should be handled similarily from an abort() kind of case that a panic can cause, above.
    * see if I've handled all cases by inspecting recent stuff I made in sandbox/rust/05*/

* make panic handling in rust_panic_with_hook() handle recursive panics and sig handlers for abort
  * what to do if abort is intercepted by a sig handler that returns control
    * does catch_unwind catch this?
      \ well, it does only if I panic!() within the sigabrt handler
    * if can't catch, then add another path to exit like exit(128+6)
      \ maybe add that anyway? it can be trapped by atexit anyway
  * detect if in fork(aka child)
  * see if I've handled all cases by inspecting recent stuff I made in sandbox/rust/05*/

* see if global allocator has all its funcs overriden
  * like realloc, iirc I did see at some point, but it's not in my current way I override global allocator.

* for memtesting purposes of a specific memory area
  \ without keeping a copy anywhere of the initial data(aka randoms) that you generate
  \ but still assuming that the stack memory isn't bad memory tho.
  \ but I'm unsure, atm, if streaming(in rust) means heap allocations are happening?
  * get a stream of randoms for X size
  * pass stream thru a crc computator
    * one pass thru it will compute 8 crcs, for each byte ror-ed from 0 to 7
      \ without needing to keep the whole input in a buffer
      \ one byte at a time, or maybe a minimum is needed, unsure.
  * write that stream to an area of memory of X size
  * compute 8 checksums of the area, each time ror-ing each byte from 0 to 7
  * compare with the ones that crc computator generated
  * if all equal, bam, good-"enough" memory
