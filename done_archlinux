// 
// new le.patch for /home/user/build/1packages/4used/xfce4-notifyd-git
// and PKGBUILD and *.install files are changed!
// lookslike I don't have xfce4-notifyd on Gentoo with lxqt(didn't yet run lxqt/startx) placed the patch in anyway: /patches/portage/xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd-0.4.4
--------
// changed file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/91-keyboard.conf
------
// find out what bwrap uses for DNS because it's not my glibc! so dns queries are invisible
// oh yes it does, but showdns doesn't have a capture for it! well ok, it's dmesg which doesn't catch it because of different namespace!
// fixed by # --dev-bind /dev/log /dev/log  required so that the dns lookup requests can be logged (via openlog() and syslog() from glibc, to host's dmesg!), because --dev /dev  just uses a new one I guess.
