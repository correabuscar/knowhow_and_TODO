copy the newer changes for these files from archlinux to gentoo:

------
(new)blugon PKGBUILD and patch(es)
^ actually not sure where to copy these!
------

some other packages/PKGBUILDs got updated(manually) since last saved q1q
------
----

firefox's user.js got updated! (copied it into /home/user/1TODO/newer)
so use the live dir when updating the i87k gentoo firefox:
/home/user/build/1packages/4used/firefox-hg
------
updated linuxgit linux-git.install file! for mkinitcpio, seems not needed for Gentoo tho! ie. no mkinitcpio on Gentoo!
updated linux-stable le9h.patch (if nothing else), for 5.5.5 stable kernel, get it from $ cdks
currently no linux kernel patches are present on Gentoo!
-------
NIC_replug.patch got(newly) commented out in linuxgit PKGBUILD for linux-stable to not warn me on dmesg because it loaded the wrong PHY for LAN

new linuxgit patch: NIC_replug_reminder.patch
for Z575!
------
--------
/home/user/build/2nonpkgs/rust.stuff/rust.vim/
doesn't yet exist in Gentoo
and it needs the ~/.vim/bundle/rust.vim symlink updated to point to it!

none of 2nonpkgs exist yet!
--------
bitbucket login page/dashboard shows empty webpage so I can't login!(currently, with firefox - didn't try any other browser)
bitbucket needs asmjs in about:config to be true!!!
but dashboard is still empty!

follow these for the hg/mercurial bug:
https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issues/2347/bug-lookuperror
https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issues/3386/no-match-found
https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issues/5504/many-bugs-using-thg-for-unity-project

------
make the following into ~/bin/regenkernel

$ cd /tmp/genkernel.outdir
$ sudo -u _kernelbuilder -g _kernelbuilder -- make nconfig
--------
updated on Z575 archlinux:
hosts:  /etc/hosts
firefox-hg patches got updated
myrules firewall:  /etc/iptables/myrules.v4
^ wasn't yet put on i87k, but still gotta remember to use this one instead of the one restored!
-----
----
// bash-devel got a new patch, copy to i87k
// the one with history load times notification if over 1sec
------
put this on the new github account

----
// new SN
----
// changed:
// ~/bin/fwall_android_internet
-----
// /etc/hosts.dnsmasq
// got changed
// placed it in /etc on gentoo!
------
~/build/1packages/4used/dnsmasq-git
got changed PKGBUILD
------
only on Z575:
amdmsrtweaker-lnx needs a new location
and a way to get started at startup since openrc is on gentoo instead of systemd!
get kernel compilation to place the proper kernel modules in amdmsrtweaker-lnx 's dir, as it did on archlinux!

-------
don't forget the msr and cpuid kernel modules! on the installcd usb stick!
for amdmsrtweaker-lnx
--------

// fixed ~/bin/def
added changed repo: /home/user/build/2nonpkgs/cambridge-cli
-----
at the finale, check that the patches on Gentoo are up to date with those on archlinux!
--------
remove all '-t' args from mktemp in scripts, the template XXXXX will still be kept but this way the dir used is the one in -p aka --tmpdir instead of the one in $TMPDIR

$ grep -nrIFw mktemp | grep -- -t|wc -l

// on gentoo /etc/mc/mc.charsets is missing; but not on archlinux!
// apparently not, so ignoring

if so, update its policy:
/etc/ImageMagick-7/policy.xml
it has some security fixes inside it! on archlinux!
--------

// done via /etc/portage/env/net-misc/openssh file which is sourced, used post_src_install() {} function!
// doneFIXME: this didn't work as expected, old .dist* files got overwritted! possibly due to $ED being empty? no, $ED isn't empty! and for some reason it worked now: eg. IMPORTANT: config file '/etc/ssh/.dist.ssh_config' needs updating. So idno why! looks like it only works if I manually edit it! but if it's leftover from prev. package, it's just overwritten!
//  I think I need to emulate manual user modification, ie. after package is merged! done via function post_pkg_postinst() in /etc/portage/env/net-misc/openssh

do I replace tlp with laptop-mode-tools on Gentoo?
if I keep tlp, then I've to change it's config on archlinux first, make sure it uses /etc/tlp.d/ dir, see: https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html#config13
if I replace tlp then see: https://github.com/rickysarraf/laptop-mode-tools
which doesn't exist on archlinux!

fix 'mount' to show the 'Entry' text for mount -at also, currently it only shows it for these:

mount: Entry '2' exit code: '0'
+ mount /var/tmp

mount: /var/tmp/portage: special device /dev/zram3 does not exist.
mount: Entry '1' exit code: '32'
mount: /var/tmp/portage: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on tmpfs, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
mount: Entry '2' exit code: '32'

a saying:
"if it's opensource, you're just the conduit for its creation"
you aka the author
because everyone seeing/using it, adds(creatively) to it by intentive toughts+feelings, which obviously can create in the past too!
ok, technically not "just" ! you do play a big part(edit: in manifesting it-14july2020), presumably.
--------

the wima method: just invented it, 17 may 2020 04:00am, the 'which is more attractive' method. Split the issue into binary choices questions, ask the question and feel which one of the two answers is more attractive. If you're "good" at it, you should "guess" it right, presumably. This did, afterwards, remind me of the movie The Celestine Prophecy (2012) the motorcycle path choice.

So using this, one should be able to guess the private key by asking the is bit 1 or 0 given this position in the key... but that's advanced wima level, I suppose.

Maybe I should make an app to test the wima level of people.
So for example, guess the number(from 0 to 100) by splitting the interval and asking yourself if the number is bigger or larger than the middle of interval, then redo for remaining interval(s) recursively.

Maybe level 1 wima test should be: is bit 1 or 0, and that's all, no bigger numbers.

  //get patches from: https://bugs.gentoo.org/756238
  //maybe? sure!
  //get multilib.eclass patch
  get dev-util/pkgconf patch however, I've no means of applying it other than copying pkgconf ebuild and files into localrepo then applying it there, manually; it's there in localrepo currently!
  //try pulseaudio without localrepo as per fixed https://bugs.gentoo.org/756196#c6
------
  //very hard: fix spidermonkey and firefox compilation: https://bugs.gentoo.org/753218#c20
------
  look into reptyr https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/issues/84
  this should allow me to reparent emerge on gentoo from a ssh session to the console (not tested yet!) just in case I want to shutdown the ssh and wasn't already running it inside something like screen or tmux.
------
  on gentoo, need to ensure portage user and possibly even _kernelbuilder user, and my "user" have this cargo config from: ~/.cargo/config
  //done this://OR, just set RUSTFLAGS for each host?!
  fixme: some -Z flags can't be in RUSTFLAGS or stage0 rustc while building rust fails compilation because -Z can only exist on nightly rustc
------
  //make sure gentoo's compilation of rust respects some settings from my archlinux config.toml /home/user/build/2nonpkgs/rust.stuff/rust/config.toml
------
  //see on gentoo if this .js overrides my vendor.js in same location:
  ///usr/lib64/firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/all-gentoo.js
  //it does!!!!
  //overridden some values in /var/db/repos/localrepo/www-client/firefox/files/gentoo-default-prefs.js

  //in gentoo's X, after $ startx  the mouse and keyboard aren't responding!

  //Permission denied.
  //I had USE=-elogind  on xorg-server package, from long ago! even tho it was USE=elogind globally ! recompiling... works now!

  //see about mozconfig when compiling firefox on gentoo
------
  //see if I need to do any KMS stuff to replace fbcon or wut, on gentoo: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide#Kernel_modesetting
  //and then on laptop! after gentoo is installed!
  //and then check if moving windows is as smooth as with archlinux!
  //since CONFIG_DRM=y it auto selects the framebuffer stuff! so the question is do I need this DRM thing? apparently I do because 'radeon' module(or builtin) is under it as CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=y even that wiki says so https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Guide
  //so I don't see how to disable legacy framebuffer drivers ...
  //wait, maybe I misread 'make nconfig' info, if I can disable CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y then it might work!
  //this makes the screen go black (even backlighting is off) on both laptop and desktop PC! - so restoring!

  //make this work on gentoo: rustc -C target-cpu=help
  //even with system-llvm
  //already have 2 patches for llvm respectively rust, but apparently the rust one had no effect even tho -DHAVE_SYSTEMLLVM_PATCH_FOR_TARGET_CPUS was set in /etc/portage/env/dev-lang/rust
  //yeah that g++ -D flag won't get passes, so opted to completely replace with #if 1

  get some inspiration for writing uBlock Origin ebuild from https://gentoo.zugaina.org/AJAX/Ebuild/43971087/View
  but don't use that public dir to place the .xpi there, it won't work due to firefox now not being built with --allow-addon-sideload
  hmm, so either use a different public dir, or don't make it an ebuild and install the .xpi on currently ran firefox hmm...
------
  try sccache firefox compilation
  see: https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/blob/master/docs/DistributedQuickstart.md
  maybe disable incremental compilation: https://github.com/mozilla/sccache#rust
------
  modify ccache on gentoo so that if ran as root it will exit(1)
  this way can catch which ebuilds are making root-owned files in /ccache/
------
  get this flac to mp3 fuse filesystem: https://gentoo.zugaina.org/Overlays/jmesmon/sys-fs/mp3fs
  there's already in gentoo repo: version 0.91-r1 as sys-fs/mp3fs
------
  test that kdump/kexec works in gentoo! see: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel_Crash_Dumps
  use that echo c | tee /proc/sysrq-trigger
------
  // new play script

  /var/db/repos/gentoo/www-misc/profile-sync-daemon/profile-sync-daemon-6.35.ebuild
  ewarn "${PN}-6 and later dropped OpenRC and /etc/psd.conf support"
  ewarn "See https://github.com/graysky2/profile-sync-daemon#note-for-version-6"
  make it somehow use openrc! else it requires systemd which is unacceptable!
------
  save ~/.config/PulseEffects/output/moo11.json
  they are the presets for pulseeffects
  and others for pulseeffects!
  add that dir to rsank?
------
  maybe move ~/.config/PulseEffects into ~/bin/confHOME/ just like the other stuff!
------
  change/patch kernel so that when using memtest=3 (>=0) kernel arg/cmdline, it will hang if any mem errors are found unless some kind of new kernel arg is present at cmdline(presumably added via pressing 'e' on grub on next boot, if wanting to bypass the hang) Why? this will allow me to notice any new memory errors rather than miss them for the session due to not checking dmesg.
------
  // get the pgup/pagedown grub patch to gentoo
  make the patch better tho (currently PgUp/PgDn will move 14 lines!)
------
  // kernel patch 2000_bios_usb_legacy_Lenovo_Z575_avoid_CPU_Not_Responding_for_kernel_5_10_1.patch
------
  investigate that cargo/rust output truncation, see file: output_truncated_rust_or_emerge.log
------
  some ~/bin/ got modified again! copy to gentoo!
------
  find out why md5sum a file name with a \ aka \\ in its name prepends a \ in front of the output md5 checksum line! thus causing it to fail recheck!
