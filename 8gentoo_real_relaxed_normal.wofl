* 17jan2020 this doc is for both  virtualbox(to compile a new/modified -admincd-(not admincd) installcd iso) and (then) for bare-metal, gentoo installation!
  \ warning: some lines/things were left uncommented and yet are outdated and are to be avoided.
- INCOMPLETE - ignore this! (since I've removed sda which was the dest, and sdb which was source is now sda)
* Note: these are the steps to install gentoo(unstable(~amd64), non-hardened, no-multilib, normal, default/linux/amd64/13.0/no-multilib , FROM THE CURRENT RUNNING GENTOO SYSTEM!!!(using this system as the iso contents to copy over!) with btrfs on sda1, with /boot on btrfs on sda1, no lvm or luks, bootable by grub, not prompted for any grub or luks passwords, on my real lenovo laptop Z575 (so, not virtualbox! but this originated as a copy of 6gentoo_real_hardened.wofl);

  * HDD vdi 80G  dynamic!! (never use: fixed)  - ok trying fixed this time to see if it has any effect on compile speed (actually I've used 29G last time, which were btrfs lzo compressed nicely to 20G, so I should consider larger size! there won't be enough space to compile chromium!)
    \ so use dynamic here to avoid writing all gigs at the start
    \ click to browse where to put it (for my case)
    \ note: other settings are later on! (like set as SSD)
  * in System:
    * remove floppy from System
    * in Processor tab:

      * don't tick live cd/dvd

    * click Controller: SATA and enable: Use Host I/O Cache
    * set HDD to be SSD (aka nonrotational)
      * tick Solid-state Drive on the device below Controller: SATA
      * don't tick Hot-pluggable (vbox 5)
      - to get discard to work (if your .vdi is dynamic!!) which will resize your dynamic .vdi harddisk file but this means lots of writes will happen during resizing(on the host!).
        - click OK
        - exit virtualbox, close window, and make sure there wasn't any other window open(maybe other running virtualboxes are ok)
        - edit .vbox file(it's in the folder with the same name as the name you gave to this virtualbox when you created it) search for nonrotational and add next to it:
          \ discard="true"
          \ XXX: this will shrink dynamic/fixed (yes either! tested! virtualbox 4.3.20) .vdi file when TRIM happens inside guest OS - this means lots of writes on the host though - so don't use this, unless you lack space and you're not on a SSD(on host)
          \ without this, hdparm -I /dev/sda  doesn't report TRIM as supported inside guest OS
          \ setting this to true will hurt you if you lvremove root volume even though it cost nothing to create it, the .vdi is 12G now, but after lvremove it will write 12G to get it down to like 200MB let's say. So for this reason, do not use discard! not using discard might cost only SSD write amplification because .vdi will never shrink; well whatever.
        - ok set discard="false"  for now! because we don't want the overhead of shrinking!!!
        - start virtualbox
    * optional: add another SSD to be used for ccache that you can detach later if you want to use it in another virtual machine! this will speed up the compilation times because it's using ccache! (even tho it has no effect for when using gentoo normal and then gentoo hardened for example)
      \ made a 70G one, ticked SSD flag.
  * in Audio:
    * Enable Audio
      * Host Audio Driver: PulseAudio
      * Audio Controller: ICH AC97
      * extended features
        \ allow only Enable Audio Output to be ticked, leave unticked: Enable Audio Input
    * some workaround
      \ didn't do it now, 06jan2020 (unsure if it was needed, yet - didn't have X to test)
      * close all virtualbox instances or something, so that you can:
      * edit its corresponding *.vbox file, to
      * remove: codec="AD1980"  or else you can't hear(on host) the pulseaudio sound that works well inside guest
        \ +      <AudioAdapter controller="AC97" driver="Pulse" enabled="true"/>
        \ -      <AudioAdapter controller="AC97" codec="AD1980" driver="Pulse" enabled="true"/>
  * in Network:
    * set Adapter 1, Attached to: NAT   (this is set by default)
      \ we'll use dhcp IPs given by virtualbox eg. 10.0.2.15
      \ port forwarding will be done later.
    * note that adapter type is: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)
    - set Adapter 1, Attached to: Bridged Adapter
      \ XXX: the problem with this is that it requires my physical router be connected on my LAN in order for my ssh to virtualbox VM sessions to work (they use the LAN IPs) ie. unplugging LAN cable will freeze all ssh sessions and they time out after a few mins.
  * Serial Ports (to see dmesg on kernel oops/panics)
    * Port 1
      \ COM1, IRQ 4, I/O 0x3F8
      \ Port Mode: RAW File
      \ Port File Path: /tmp/gentoovmnormal3_80g_com1.txt
      - in kernel cmdline of the guest OS(so, later!) add: DONE: move this below!
        \ console=tty1,ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=vga,serial,ttyS0,115200,keep
        \ ^ that isn't working! (because there was an earlier: console=tty1 earlyprintk=vga) - just make sure there are no other occurrences of console= and earlyprintk=
        \ //but this is:
        \ //console=ttyS0,115200n8,tty1 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200,keep,vga
        \ //^ works but ttyS0 is console and tty1 is NOT! so can't input luks password for example.
        \ DONE: Well you can increase the speed actually, to: 115200  or maybe more, haven't tested with anything other than 9600
        \ for some reason 115200 is slow! possibly just like 9600 or slower!,, actually I can't tell the difference, maybe 115200 is faster than 9600 or same? but it should be visible!!!
        \ takes lots of minutes to boot! keep it disabled!
  * Shared Folders
    * add shared folder and Folder Name it as: vmsharedfolder
      \ set path to /home/user/vmsharedfolder  (and folder name will become it automatically)
      \ select Auto Mount
      \ no readonly and no mount point
      \ press OK, access should be Full, seen in list now.
- (virtualbox) see howtos -> build your own admincd iso, since that's what we're using to install this on bare-metal!
  \ after having installed gentoo inside virtualbox, see the howtos to get my own admincd iso!(with non-hardened kernel, hopefully)
* install gentoo
  * boot from custom made liveCD(instructions are in this same file you're reading from) using no boot params when prompted:
    \ #SECONDBOOT (secondboot=things you need to do if you need to boot from CD again because booting after install failed or because you took a break)
    * to view this file (from your custom iso) - on bare-metal install! (not for virtualbox gentoo install)
      * cd ~ && mkdir here && mount /dev/sde2 here

    * kernel args to boot with!
      \ #SECONDBOOT
      * (virtualbox) gentoo-nofb ipv6.disable=1 nokeymap loglevel=15 log_buf_len=16M mitigations=off
      * (baremetal) gentoo ipv6.disable=1 nokeymap loglevel=15 log_buf_len=16M mitigations=off docache nodhcp
        \ mitigations=off for spectre/metdown etc. mitigations to be off/disables, so that compile speed is fastest!
        \ docache will read the whole "iso" in RAM before continuing, so you can unplug usbstick as soon as it finished booting.
        \ Don't use "nodhcp" if you're doing it inside virtualbox.
        \ 'debug'(arg) shouldn't be necessary it stops like 2-3 times with a shell and continues only on exit!
        \ using 'gentoo' instead of 'gentoo-nofb' works but the virtualbox screen is too big and requires scrolling on Z575 (768 pixels height)
        \ XXX: gentoo-nofb is required or else it will lockup with the normal fb one when loading modules! unless using admincd.iso which seems to be working!
        \ XXX: nodhcp so you don't have to pkill dhcpcd due to some bug (but still have to stop it due to another bug; yes ifconfig shows it still got loaded and you got yourself an IP - tested inside virtualbox)
        \ noipv6 is needed for gpg trying to access keyserver via ipv6 addresses
        \ there's no such option: noipv6
        \ use ipv6.disable=1  instead
    - /etc/init.d/rpcbind stop
      \ this kills listening rpcbind (on eg. port 111 and others, nfs related )
    * setup networking (only when NOT using NAT in virtualbox, so do this when using Bridged, or if on bare-metal)
      * /etc/init.d/dhcpcd stop
        \ this works if you use nodhcp above

            - XXX: OK, so if partition is GPT(so protective MBR has the partition type set to EE aka GPT; and this boot partition we're making is in fact inside GPT so not seen here in protective MBR) then this Lenovo Z575 BIOS will not boot from it (probably because it's expecting something like a fat32 partition inside the GPT? or something GPT related!)
              \ tested by changing partition type(of the only partition from protective MBR) with fdisk, from EE to 8E(linux lvm) [83 aka Linux, same effect; also tried: EF which is "EFI(FAT-12/16/" - same]
              \ sudo fdisk -t dos /dev/sdb
              \ ^ with that command from Manjaro.('cause it boots faster than from usbstick(which does in 3m40s))
              \ but GRUB says it cannot find that cryptodisk!! which may be so because it cannot see it's a GPT at all anymore, due to the partition type ID change!
              \ so now what I could do, is teach GRUB that some other partition type is in fact GPT so it treats it as it would if it were of type EE(aka GPT), and this way it could find the cryptodisk; and at the same type being of non-EE type, then this Z575 BIOS won't get confused and not boot from it at all! OH but wait! this means a lot of other programs (even the kernel) I'd have to patch to see partition type 10 (let's say; which is OPUS) as EE (which is GPT), so not just GRUB! So, others might include LVM, grub2, kernel, cryptsetup.
              \ done: see if bootable flag is actually needed at all! XXX: If bootable flag on the protective MBR is unset then my BIOS ignores that disk and doesn't try to boot from it! Just the same as it does with if the partition is (bootable and) set to GPT(0xEE)
              \ MBR sector layout and partition table offsets: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record#Sector_layout
              \ XXX: ok so here's the deal: z575 bios ignores non-bootable(marked) partitions AND bootable 0xEE(aka GPT type) partitions: so the fix is simple! add new dummy bootable-marked 0x10(OPUS, for example) type partition which has startsector/endsector/startCHS/endCHS all 0('cause why bother, since it works this way - tested).

        \ RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
        \ The  restricted  deletion  flag  or  sticky  bit is a single bit, whose
        \ interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it  prevents
        \ unprivileged  users  from  removing or renaming a file in the directory
        \ unless they  own  the  file  or  the  directory;  this  is  called  the
        \ restricted  deletion  flag  for the directory, and is commonly found on
        \ world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files on some  older
        \ systems,  the  bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so
        \ it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

                      \ and to fix it (temporarily) you have to edit the kernel and initrd lines and prepend the boot device location as: (hd0,gpt2) for example. Seen when you get into cmdline and do `ls` then `ls (hd0,gpt2)/` to see where your kernel and initrd are located in order to find the correct values for (hd0,gpt2) from the listed ones with `ls`.
                      \ this is just temporary fix to let you boot in, and overrides the wrong search lines which point to your rootfs /  eg. /dev/sda3  instead to your /boot or /dev/sda2 which they should point to, including the set root= line! the UUID is also wrongly pointing to / instead of /boot so it's not enough to just change the (hd0,gpt3) into (hd0,gpt2) where you see them. But just prepending the right, (hd0,gpt2) that is, partition to kernel and initrd lines will get you into booting the system and you now only have to fix grub2-mkconfig with the above sed command before rerunning it again to fix it

    * use $ and # in front of commands (here in this .wofl file)
    * use another ssh session for the non-root user and only emerge stuff from within it.
  - get quilt for generating patches
    \ emerge -nav quilt
    \ 1m36s
    \ how to use: http://www.mpagano.com/blog/?p=25
    \ quilt new patchname.patch
    \ quilt edit file  (to auto add file to patch then run vim on it)
    \ quilt diff  (see what's changed since new patch)
    \ quilt refresh  (to ensure the  quilt diff   is saved into the patch file)
  * patch emerge to NOT copy to the destination if the file exists(in case of re-emerges) and it has the same contents (ie. by checksum comparison, or diff comparisions) - also check if it removes files from previous emerge when reemerging, or it leaves them untouched before copying over them.
  - install pfl and use  e-file cmdhere  instead of  equery b cmdhere  to find out which (non-installed!) package provides the command
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Pfl
  * holyf that kexec works http://gentoo-en.vfose.ru/wiki/Kexec
    - keyboard was locked up due to Shift+PgUp/Dn attemps which didn't work, after and while a reboot with kexec but apparently works ok if instead is left alone(not press keys) until booted to login prompt. XXX: locks up due to RShift being held down (likely during kexec boot, but not during boot) https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92881
  - add mosh and tmux to replace ssh
    * actually use mosh instead of ssh
  * zfs lacks TRIM https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/1016
    * when TRIM is implemented, then you can consider using ZFS, but be aware that they are not very active in fixing bugs ie. https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/labels/Bug%20-%20Major

  - make separate /boot partition that's luks with a different key - ie. different luks device than root
  * make 4G btrfs LVM root and resize it later after install
    \ to train myself how to resize it
    \ I think I need to boot from livecd, or online resizing works? hmm
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LVM#Extend_LV
    \ btrfs filesystem resize max /mnt
    \ src: http://www.funtoo.org/BTRFS_Fun
    \ "And yes, it is an on-line resize, there is no need to umount/shrink/mount."
  - ensure cpu firmware is included in kernel (this may not be needed inside virtualbox)
  * check grub2-install param --pubkey and see if it applies for non-EFI too
    \ to boot signed kernel
    \ "--pubkey=FILE  embed FILE as public key for signature checking"
    \ see: info grub  18.2 Using digital signatures in GRUB
    * can I run coreboot inside virtualbox? what about in other emulators?
      \ apparently not in virtualbox, yet, but yes in QEMU
  - enable debug USE flag
    \ http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml
    \ XXX: only enable this flag per package, never globally (don't put it in USE in /etc/portage/make.conf)
  - ccache
    \ emerge --ask dev-util/ccache
    \ more to do: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features#Caching_compilation_objects
  * XXX: don't make /home on separate partition because btrfs would be less effective this way; TODO: but what if it were a subvolume?
  - /var/tmp must be like /tmp  - tmpfs !
    \ ONLY for when enough ram is available, apparently only 50% (2G out of 4G) RAM is used for any tmpfs, by default !
    * find a way to use 75% of RAM with any tmpfs
  - emerge --ask app-crypt/gnupg
    \ to have gpg inside chroot !
  - add sshd early so we can actually copy/paste!
    \ /etc/init.d/sshd start
  * see FIXME ones
  * emerge --color y --search something | less -R
    \ this may be better than e-file  except that e-file searches online and can probably find non-existent ones too.
  * use eix instead of emerge --search  ; this is better than e-file ! (try: e-file eutils (no results) then eix eutils and you see a bunch with that word in their name)
    \ more info: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Eix
    \ search is way faster ie. eix kernel  or  eix -S -c corba
    * time emerge -navt eix
      \ //5m24s (oldtime)
      \ //5m32s (with 2 youtube vids playing in firefox)
      \ 12m7s
    * time eix-update
      \ to create the database, before you can use eix
    - but DON'T use eix-sync -w -v  WARNING: because it can't keep the downloaded file as emerge-webrsync -k could! (I don't see an option to pass -k to it)
      \ will do emerge-webrsync (instead of emerge --sync) which is the only thing we want since it checks gpg signature (when webrsync-gpg option is set in FEATURES)
      \ but since can't pass -k then don't use it!
      - DON'T use emerge-delta-webrsync
        \ Looking for available base versions for a delta
        \ no base found.  resorting to pulling a full version
        \ uhmmmm
        \ also it doesn't download or check gpgsig!!!
        * emerge --ask emerge-delta-webrsync
        * eix-sync -W -v
          \ -W to use it
  * read cheat sheet
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Cheat_Sheet
  * when in X, get to this: XDG cache to tmpfs
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SSD#XDG_cache
  * SSD optimizations
    * read and apply some stuff from here:
      \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SSD#Considerations
  - TODO: remove unicode USE flag, for the next install/try
    \ -unicode
  * get a new kernel .config stripped for virtualbox (lots of work/time)
  * make genkernel build kernel inside RAM instead of /usr/src/linux - this only makes sense when using ccache, otherwise we do want to keep object files around to reduce compilation time next time genkernel --no-clean is ran.
    \ 1.2G used after compilation
    \ OR/AND TODO: just skip using genkernel and do it manually
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel
  - add reboot/shutdown users
  - ensure tmpfs are mounted in fstab
    - find out how to rbind /tmp to /var/tmp inside /etc/fstab
      \ http://backdrift.org/how-to-use-bind-mounts-in-linux
      \ XXX: actually I don't want to do this, because if /tmp and /var/tmp are the same then I won't know if a certain existing file was created in /tmp or in /var/tmp and besides this doesn't use any extra RAM
  * make sure kernel has Whirlpool support, not just sha stuff
  - check out LUKS
    \ https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/DM-Crypt_LUKS
    \ info grub  - can boot from luks
  * check out gpg luks
    \ man 7 dracut.cmdline search for rd.luks.key
  * grub gpg signed kernel
    \ https://balu-wiki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/linux/grub2.html#boot-only-signed-kernel-and-ramdisk
    \ info grub
  * find a way to make emerge show FEATURES too, when emerge --ask --verbose  , not just USE flags
  - remove that SYNC line from make.conf at the right point and write it in this .wofl
  * don't actually use discard flag, use fstrim instead, because just in case I wanna recover some recently accidentally deleted file but also because deleting a ton of files at once is freezy
