* remember tlp and powertop when installing in arch(arch=archlinux but we're going gentoo now instead!)
  \ systemctl status tlp    if not enabled, enable it!
  * tlp is a bunch of scripts for arch or manjaro; doesn't exist on gentoo
* find out what other errors happen on reboot
  * find a way to delay/stop(wait for Enter to be pressed) the rebooting action at the end, so to can read the msgs!(since they won't hit the disk due to mounted ro)

* note the mc macrovariables like %D %d %p %p etc
  \ http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/MC/macrovariables.shtml

* acpidump corrupted double linked list
  * test the new version to see if it's fixed
* add that acpi_debug.txt patch to kernel PKGBUILD to avoid getting dmesg spam

* vgacon scrollback buffer
  * DO THIS FIRST maybe merge the two patches, because it's getting harder to maintain/add features to only one of them
  * shift+up/down should scroll up/down only 1 line per keypress
  * find a way to add shift+ctrl+PgUp go to top of SB and shift+ctrl+PgDn to go to end
  * find a way to prevent new output from messing up the scrollback position
  * remember scrollback position even after switching consoles
  * find a way to dump contents of scrollback buffer
    * allow only root to do it
      * maybe expose it in /sys/class/vtconsole/
  * printk when console scrollbuffer is being allocated (aside from first time, which is already printed)
* see if we can use this bash history audit thing
  \ http://www.pointsoftware.ch/howto-bash-audit-command-logger/
* use set -e
  \ makepkg is likely using it for PKGBUILD
* find out why bash completion for tlp isn't working? file is in: /etc/bash_completion.d
* urxvt
  * make shift+mousewheel scroll horizontally (shouldn't be too hard by modyfing the mouse scrollwheel patch)
  - investigate a slowdown and cpu 100% usage issue with urxvt when it processed many screens of text, works in normal screen but also with secondScreen (ie. less) it will scroll slower as PgDn is held during less, and scroll faster again as PgUp is coming near the top of the file in less.
  \ this doesn't seem to happen with seq  seq 100000|less
  \ but happens with grep -r kernel --exclude-dir=.config --exclude-dir=build|less  in my home dir (i see lots of urls tho)
  \ wow PgDn scroll is done line by line, i just realize - it became that slow that I can see it - maybe less is doing this line-by-line scrolling, and it's slow because urxvt got slow although since we're in secondScreen, it isn't really supposed to be storing the scrolllines, right?
  \ FOUND: it's because of long lines (no \n) like 72000 chars line will slow down pagedown scroll in less to the point that you can see line-by-line scrolling when trying pagedown once.
  * find out why switching window to bigger (Ctrl+Alt+4) causes:
  \ error: command terminated by signal 13: Broken pipe
  \ while compiling linux-git
  \ and when pacman is prompting it exits with: :: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] -----------
  \ that --- is from pacman, supposed to be on next line tho
  \ NOTE: this also happens during mouse window resize(ie. Alt+F8) when size changes (rows/columns!)
  * (like impossible) make ability to select with the mouse, more than one screen while in secondScreen (ie. less) - currently the selection deselects if moved outside top/bottom. 
  * explore this urxvt perl script, just in case I want to do something similar or even use this one.
    \ https://github.com/johntyree/urxvt-perls/blob/master/rotate-colors
  - make less enter second screen (when used from git diff, 'cause otherwise less worked ok) and thus allows scrollwheel patch to work
  * make numEnter do Enter in less while search is on, pressing / key
  * find a way to copy to clipboard(the clipboard that eg. mousepad uses when Ctrl+C) via keyboard, so that Ctrl+Alt+V pastes it! while middle click pastes the other clipboard(X clipboard?)
  * see the clipboard options here https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls
  * find a way to change title bar to reflect currently executing command not just current folder
  - patch urxvt to add 2 more options to set border color when not in focus, just like fading happens when not in focus
  * find a way to make shift+up/down arrows scroll buffer
  - fixed a bunch with xmodmap

  - Home/End keys on keypad, inside vim command ":" mode aren't working as normal Home/End keys, but do work in xfce4-terminal
  - Ctrl+left/right don't jump one word, but do  in xfce4-terminal
  \ in .inputrc
  \ "\eOc": forward-word     # Ctrl+right  => forward word
  \ "\eOd": backward-word    # Ctrl+left   => backward word
  - Home/End on keypad, while in mc, not working
  * find a way to paste a line that's on two lines(in mc viewer only!), but it's obviously just one, paste it as one line instead of two - xfce4-terminal does it correctly
    \ actually this works fine in bash
    \ but not within midnight commander's file viewer, with word wrap on (F2)
    \ neither urxvt nor xfce4-terminal work with this case!
    \ in mc with mouse disabled (mc --nomouse) still doesn't work, - it works in vim editor or bash command line
  * when word wrap isn't on (F2) in mc, searching for something (F7, Shift+F7) doesn't show it on screen if it's past the screen on the same line to the right.
  - apply this urxvt patch for Ctrl+L (try `seq 1000` then C-L, scroll up, they're gone from 980->1000)
    \ this one's better: https://github.com/jjk-jacky/rxvt-unicode/commits/clear

  - scrolldown with mouse wheel while viewing a man page doesn't work as long as the text below wasn't already seen/loaded before. works with xfce4-terminal though
    \ apply this urxvt patch https://github.com/jjk-jacky/rxvt-unicode/commit/bf7f54bc2449372b5061cf4e50106be252bc0f71
  - numpad PgUp/PgDn in less, not working
* vim
  * see why vim doesn't know how to indent PKGBUILD when function names contain _ and - such as package_linux-git-headers()  all inner code is indented with 0 spaces
  * numpad keys: up/down/Home/End/5/left/right (except PgUp and PgDn) are broken in vim!
    \ well it's because something was overriding xmodmap so I had to reload it: xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
    - fixed that by making sure /etc/profile reloads xmodmap from ~
      * found it! - sometimes pacman installs execute this: source /etc/profile  which does change the mapping of keys and requires running: xmodmap ~/Xmodmap !! finally this issue is found!
    * TODO: test open vim and enter insert mode then Ctrl+Left to see if it works, if it doesn't make sure xmodmap is loaded in xinitrc ! 'cause this fixes it when reloading it in terminal.
    \ maybe that's why I was getting some lockups in mc with keypad keys hmm
      * nope that's not why, see why keypad keys and up/down of non-keypad keys for example(not just them) lock-up in some cases, not sure what's the fix! but xmodmap (re)loading isn't it but seems to happen after a vim session while in mc. Could be urxvt doing it, quitting the terminal altogether is the "solution" for that terminal. Starting up a new one works fine, but just quitting mc, loading xmodmap and starting mc again doesn't unlock the keys.
        \ this is a different issue, apparently related to mc !! probably not urxvt because I remember xfce4-terminal having the same issue in mc
        \ this doesn't modify xmodmap at all! at least not the -pke part And the -pk part!
        \ but quitting mc and re-entering does fix it! and what brokes it is running a command, like ls, then when back: broken  ie. keypad star  key
        \ changing folder(ie. enter on it) fixes it also!
        * need to check if executing 'cd' (when pressing enter on a folder) does anything different from executing a cmd like 'ls' - maybe the former restores some things!
  - see why vim doesn't enter second screen (as per urxvt) but less does
    \ so, while in vim, mousewheelup will scroll past the vim screen into what was in the shell before
    \ actually less doesn't either, at least when there's scrollback(which is not what you have when you just started the terminal)
    \ works with jjacky's mouseWheel patch
  - make background transparent, or urxvt's second screen background transparent
  - make blue line show ok on blue text, eg. /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
    \ hi CursorLine   cterm=NONE ctermbg=darkred ctermfg=white guibg=darkred guifg=white
    \ actually, made it bold: highlight CursorLine cterm=bold
  - check why shift+left/right works to move past words but ctrl+left/right doesn't!
    \ both versions were working with xfce4-terminal, in both insert and non-edit modes
* check if xmodmap can be used to set mouse button 8&9 (as per xev) as being the mod3 modifier and thus can be used to move windows while held, currently Ctrl
  \ see this when ready to map mouse buttons to keyboard keys https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/All_Mouse_Buttons_Working#evrouter
* edit color for mc .xml files to not be so similar to selection color (yellow)
  * find where this is - maybe in the theme? the group for it is [doc] though
  - changed theme - temporary workaround
* finish the script for kernel 3.15 from 3.16
  - recompile next rc version
  - empty ~/.ccache before building kernel - 975M so far
* find place in workflowy*.wofl file to place these:
  * alternative email services to consider (aside from openmailbox.org ) if ever needed(in this order):
    * https://startmail.com

  \ and http://shorewall.net/simple_traffic_shaping.html
  \ and http://wiki.linuxwall.info/doku.php/en:ressources:dossiers:networking:traffic_control#motivation
  * need a better traffic shaper (wondershaper limits download rate for no reason, to like 40KB/s)

* add different timer to mouse suspend, but allow it to suspend(rather than make it stay on all the time as it is now)
  \ by peeking at dmsg: [    3.244601] input: Genius 2.4G Wireless BlueEye Mouse as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb3/3-3/3-3:1.0/0003:0458:00F2.0001/input/input8
  \ the folder is /sys//devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb3/3-3//power/autosuspend_delay_ms

  \ # echo '600000' > /sys//devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb3/3-3//power/autosuspend_delay_ms
  \ it'd be still better than nothing!
* something happened with -+* on numpad while numlock is off, inside mc - investigate why they lockup
  \ look for this in sourcecode: 
  \    * use Num_Lock to toggle Keypad on/off.  If Num_Lock is off, allow an
  \    * escape sequence to toggle the Keypad.
  \ also pressing enter after returning from shell, makes +-* work again!

  \ see if DSDT is being used to set CPU voltages/multipliers maybe we can use this to replace amdmsrtweaker this way
  \ also this: Documentation/acpi/initrd_table_override.txt
* when yaourt building a package, before build happens  some prerequisites might need installing and if they do, sudo password is given and I presume cached normally - if it's cached normally then a script could call sudo and no pass prompt would happen
* need to disable systemd-tmpfiles-clean from running whenever! just k-line it!

* investigate the epic lockup from accidentally doing: vim file|less
* include in kernel uname -a  the type (git, tip, next) so that we know which one we're running, typically tip was running before git, since it's last in /etc/mkinitcpio.d/
* fix acpi_call building for the wrong(current) kernel with dkms, even though the kernel version is being specified! see bugs/dkms/acpi_call
* get rid of mdm and all of its dependencies!
* see why bootsector(from boot partition) not mbr is messed up after plugging msproduo in 750 - maybe they rewrite it with some evil bootsector?
  \ this fixed it:  sudo syslinux -i -d /Boot/Settings /dev/sdc1
* make gopreplinks prompt to remove any /tmp/ symlinks unless any of them are dirs
  \ this allows building anything without manually having to remove those links
* check that coreboot/libreboot BIOS to see if we can replace bios
  \ http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Chipsets_and_Devices
* ensure machine-id is not existing OR use a generic one like 01234...etc.
  \ /etc/machine-id and /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
  \ pulse-audio will stop working if the /etc/ one is moved, ie. when trying to play youtube videos in chromium - will work again after chromium restart(if that file is put back) - maybe will work again after reboot

    \ now that I think about it, the steps and the link are provided in a previous section(when getting the iso) in section 2.c. of the Handbook
    \ but it may still be a good idea to mention all that in 5.b.
    * hmm, could even add those keys (from that url) into the livecd iso as trusted already - unless hmm maybe in case they get compromised in the future and the iso is now outdated, they don't want the user who uses the iso to think they are still trusted/valid

* add RAIN (cpu cool hlt instructions) while in GRUB menu/commandline to avoid 100% cpu usage!
  \ remember RAIN from DOS? it would act like Windows' System Idle cooling the cpu with hlt instructions


* investigate in bash, why "rm some\ files\ *" will remove(and tab show) "some Files *" notice the f vs F

* use i8042.c to add code to detect if a key is getting duplicated too soon, because I'm often getting double keys when I type - so it's either hardware, or software, either way hopefuly detectable with i8042
  * show only duplicated keys instead of all


* this kernel bug: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47331

* investigate why, on gentoo, in chroot(at least), on bash prompt, when freshly returned to prompt, pressing Shift+1 aka tilde(~) will not show it! pressing it again shows it once as: ~  but if instead pressing another key like 1, then both are shown at once(~1). What's with not showing it? and just pressing ~ and enter, shows it and obviously: bash: /root: Is a directory


* fix volume notifier(on top right in xfce4, when Fn+Left/RightArrows, or volup/voldown keys are pressed) from stealing focus, which it does only after it dissapears(fade out).
  \ well, can't reproduce this anymore!
  \ it's back again, maybe happens only with vlc playing(but not focused), and urxvt being focused


* cd /etc/default && colordiff -up tlp tlp.pacnew |less

* make the eutils.eclass epatch  patch report only when /etc/portage/patches is a symlink - to avoid too many warnings; even though this limits the case severely

* make `quilt edit` work if `quilt files` reports only one file, so `quilt edit` will just edit that file

* make a note and save /etc/portage/bashrc and apply the eutils.eclass patch(es)

  \ normal
  \ the prefix should be pointing to grub folder like: 
  \ set prefix=(lvm/vgall-bootlvol)/grub
  \ set root=(lvm/vgall-bootlvol)
  * add them as portage patches, don't just run sed again - because they get overwritted on next grub install or something.

* gentoo:
  * tmux:

  * add note to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config  to set UseDNS to no because without LAN, sshd tries to reverse PTR the hostname that I'm connecting from.
  * stop netmount from auto running at boot, and add to wofl

* maybe add a function to funx.bash that will save current bash settings(like shopt) and allow you to embed them in the script to warn the user that some settings are different than what the script author used when testing/running that script, so as to know that if something goes wrong, to flip some settings.

* ensure_existing_commands_or_die
  * make sure this shows the type of command when error-ing! due to 'none' meaning it found a command and is of certain type instead!
  * use funx.bash in trimtest script
    * make all funx.bash functions readonly
    - make 2 funcs to start and stop block that has set +e respectively set -e; and the stopcmd will return the same $? as exit code from the function, thus keeping the exit code without requiring caller to catch it before calling stopcmd.
      \ forgot where exactly I wanted to use this, oh yeah: executing commands! I forgot -e is not -x

* need a way to crypt (probably using pub/priv keys) such that there are two keys: one for read and one for write; so that if read is ever required (eg. for the govt.) then only the read key needs to be provided; so this way they cannot implant evidence.

  \ "Important: Deleting a root certificate that is in the default root store is equivalent to turning off all of the trust bits for that root. Therefore, even though the root certificate will re-appear in the Certificate Manager, it will be treated as though you changed the trust bits of that root certificate to turn them all off."
  \ XXX: what actually happens is, you delete the cert(even if it has all 3 options unset: to not trust it to identify websites, email and software), it comes back with the trust it to identify websites bit set!!
  \ tested on https://forum.videolan.org/ with cert named UTN-USERFirst-Hardware  serial: 44:BE:0C:8B:50:00:24:B4:11:D3:36:2A:FE:65:0A:FD

* investigate kernel scrollback bug
  \ when being switched to a vt (vc2) on second screen(eg. vim) then the first console vc1 being on first screen(not in vim, but on like bash command line) is losing scrollback that appeared while focus was on vc2

  * see if scrollback only activates when the specific screen is selected! or even, when switched away FROM! 'cause that's bad too!

    \ Dried spirulina contains about 60% (51–71%) protein.[2][3] It is a complete protein containing all essential amino acids, though with reduced amounts of methionine, cysteine, and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat, eggs, and milk. It is, however, superior to typical plant protein, such as that from legumes.[2][4][5]

      \ Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction that produces histamine from histidine with the help of vitamin B6

      \ Enzymes /ˈɛnzaɪmz/ are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.
      \ Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.[2] Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules.
      \ Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.[3][4] Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction.
      \ Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.

    * p 206 'inscrutible' should be 'inscrutable'

- already done with psd //get chromium to not write to disk, ie. temporarily copy shiet to tmpfs and the back to disk on exit, or something! because this is ridiculous! the amount of writes is way too many (even with cache in /tmp already)

* colorgcc and ccache

  * disable this in nconfig?

* get rid of LVM
  * remove leftover LUKS partitions first!


* fix scp-ed 1packages/* symlinks! by looking at source(on T400)
  \ next time zip them before scp from-ing

* undo --disable-gpu for chromium and see if it still locks up system after a while!

* transform BUG_ON in my kernel patches into something like printf&throw, then encase the main stuff into a catch and ignore it. Otherwise I won't be able to see the errors anyway!

* in mc, make Suspend the default button on copy(F5) or move(F6) instead of Skip, else if Enter key somehow gets pessed twice, it will skip once(tho, it might show the incomplete file dialog?)

* in my ~ home dir, find scripts in ~/bin that have /home/$USER and replace that with $HOME but check if $HOME is non-empty first
  * double quotes needed on some, after replacing!

* fix ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel so that I don't have to rerun 1apply_local_changes_Z575 all the time to replace it with the /tmp symlink!

TODO: update BIOS ... after making sure it's not trojaned.

--------
find out what is, in BIOS:
CFG Lock
MSR 0xE2[15], CFG Lock bit

"The “CFG Lock” is a setting that is quite new in UEFI BIOS, or appears in some manufacturers. For example, I never encountered it on my Gigabyte GA-Z87N-WIFI BIOS settings, despite using this same CPU. Nevertheless, it seems critical and related to Haswell’s power management as nearly all UEFI BIOS versions seem to “lock MSR 0xE2”. Disabling it is crucial, especially for running OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and booting stock kernel. What does this “locking” do? All I can find is that it locks cuurent C-State until the next reset occurrs. Beats me, but OS X doesn’t like it!"

see why 'less' is broken when doing case insensitive search with a word with one uppercase letter - not finding anything - but works when all letters are lowercase, regardless of how many times I do '-i' to toggle case sensitivity on/off in search!

happens during the first diff in cdq && ./check
which runs as root!

and why aren't line numbers and progress present?!

ok apparently it's due to 'sudo'
$ sudo less /root/.extend.bashrc
vs
sudo bash
less /root/.extend.bashrc

completely different less status text colors and progress shows only for the latter!
oh i see, it's because /root/.extend.bashrc doesn't load with sudo!
but why wouldn't the export still be in effect from the caller user? like
export LESS='-+X -R -+S -+F -+E -I -M --shift 5'
export LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$'\E[01;31m'
etc.

this works:
$ sudo -- bash -i -c "less /root/.extend.bashrc"
because it loads /root/.extend.bashrc
and -i is interactive
hmm -l doesn't work the same at all! i guess it's seen as not interactive w/o -i

ok but even so, why wouldn't '-i' inside 'less' toggle what it says it toggles: case sensitivity in search!

something's wrong with Xorg, or something else that uses it, because even without debug(ie. glibc, glib2) Xorg is still using a lot of CPU now, especially when switching windows (after alt+tab is released) (and it's not due to the half a sec patch on xfwm4), and also for that CPU graph plugin on the panel mainly! If I put it on 250ms it's using 96% CPU in idle! Also startx, at startup is slower than before!

tried compton and/or openbox instead of xfwm4, no difference
tried even earlier xorg/xfwm4/xfconf/nettle/xf86-video-ati no dice.
maybe it's always been like that and I'm only noticing this now?!

cpu usage is like 50% usually, but when not using xf86-video-ati(and radeon as device in conf.) then it's like 96%-100%

todo: I should install jre on Z575 too, else I'll keep adding

-------
I temp-used: $ sudo sysctl -w vm.block_dump=1
to see whether disk writes to /dev/mmcblk0 are not sequential, but they are!
dmesg |grep mmcblk0 > /tmp/a
cat /tmp/a|cut -f3 -d':' > /tmp/b
cat /tmp/a|cut -f3 -d':' |sort -k 3 -n > /tmp/c
colordiff -up /tmp/{b,c}|less
(nothing)

iotop looks like:
Total DISK READ :       0.00 B/s | Total DISK WRITE :       4.53 M/s
Actual DISK READ:       0.00 B/s | Actual DISK WRITE:       4.44 M/s
  TID  PRIO  USER     DISK READ  DISK WRITE  SWAPIN     IO>    COMMAND          
30255 be/4 user        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 99.99 % sync
 5228 be/4 root        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 99.99 % [kworker/~ush-179:0]
28018 be/4 root        0.00 B/s    3.39 M/s  0.00 % 98.69 % dd if=/de~lk0 bs=11M

so the question is, why the disk writes initially full speed at about 9MiB/sec (seen via Disk Performance Monitor (xfce4-panel plugin) but then later are just 2.99MiB/sec constantly and sometimes spikes to 3.99 ?!
What causes this slowdown? 

it was already slowed down during these(and the avg was going down):
5501878272 bytes (5.5 GB, 5.1 GiB) copied, 788.645 s, 7.0 MB/s
11707351040 bytes (12 GB, 11 GiB) copied, 2743.76 s, 4.3 MB/s
1382+0 records in
1381+0 records out
15931539456 bytes (16 GB, 15 GiB) copied, 4672.73 s, 3.4 MB/s

real  77m53.492s
user  0m0.023s
sys 0m27.792s

try disabling either of(or both):
CONFIG_BLK_WBT_MQ
CONFIG_BLK_WBT
^ idea from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92571#c2

trying both disabled:
no effect! sometimes after C-c attempt, it even went down to 1MiB constant!
Ok then, restored CONFIG_BLK_WBT  CONFIG_BLK_WBT_MQ

so apparently this slowdown happens instantly after 2GiB are written(in memory buffer aka cached) - todo: retest this

zombie 'make's are still a thing on Z575(at least) while building firefox(usually doesn't happen on first try, only if build fails 1+ times and I just continue via ./2* ):

first reported:
freenode/#archlinux.log:2385:Jun 15 07:50:27 <howaboutsynergy>  Hi. I've got some Zombie `make` processes which are causing firefox compilation to stall(forever?), any idea what could've caused them to become zombie?

^ first kernel: 5.1.9-g2df16141a2c4  (on i87k)
current kernel: 5.2.2-ge9b75c60f91a  (on Z575)

gist log: https://gist.github.com/howaboutsynergy/3339ad77dff88d3be8f57e0d98816e5b

to get rid of zombie 'make' processes, one must kill the parent 'make' (or simply C-c the (now-stalled) compilation)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16944886/how-to-kill-zombie-process

try RT kernel patch

see files in /home/user/build/1packages/4used/kernel/linux-stable/orig-linux-rt/linux-rt/

`man xfce4-terminal`
no man pages are installed via /home/user/build/1packages/4used/xfce4-terminal/
maybe this always happens for git? or some new git changes caused this?
-------
remove all gpg2 keys from i87k (used for signing commits) - already did on Z575
see also the ones inside /root/ (if any)
--
get new gpg2 signing keys?!! for both hosts!
$ gpg --full-gen-key

-------
test this? disk writes
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196157#c34
and maybe see also: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198199

maybe look into RCU stuff in kernel .config, to turn them off?

also search in this todo file because there's another similar issue to this!

//wait what? fix? https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-5.3.y&id=1e04eb03877c3e0a38c1be1845be97074a1198b6
nope, that didn't seem to have affected anything in terms of youtube videos skipping frames or freezing out right.

---------
see chrome://policy  the adminSettings policy of uBlock Origin, in chromium.
we can override that with the contents of the backup as Json value
^ see descr. /home/user/build/2nonpkgs/browser.stuff/both/uBlock/uBlock/platform/chromium/managed_storage.json

and maybe also keep the values added by the patches? even though the policy will override them
--------
use groups and the owner module of iptables to restrict chromium net access to only specific hosts

sudo -g no-internet -- "$@"
$ iptables -m owner --help

and/or make this more generic so that any process can be targeted!
-------
move uname -a stuff from rust.log into its own filename!
eg. OSes/archlinux/rust.log.hostspecific=Z575
----------

remove favorites= and recent= from //home/user/.config/xfce4/panel/whiskermenu-16.rc
at ./4 step of rsank
I think recent= is removed already! recheck!
so only favorites= must be removed next!
------
look into why kernel compilation depends on linux api headers being installed on the system, because ccache misses always if newer ones are installed! hence why ./q or `./0 q` was made.
-----
in tst, modify source code so that default for Tree Behaviour(first two options) is to NOT auto-collapse
------
segfault in pavucontrol if Ctrl+Q is pressed!
it's in #0  0x000072c1b16e7c81 in Gtk::Main::quit() () at /usr/lib/libgtkmm-3.0.so.1
/usr/lib/libgtkmm-3.0.so.1 is owned by gtkmm3 3.24.1-1
need to recompile that with debug info
------
fix ctrl+left/right in vim, on console, because I modded them to work on bash prompt(on console, not xterm) and now they don't in vim!
-------
nss 3.46 cannot be compiled due to two warnings(treated as errors)
/home/user/build/1packages/4used/nss

nss 3.45 is upstream (and installed) currently!
----
remove tcp port 46801 vnc allowances in iptables
(in two places!)
-------
profile-sync-daemon is broken with system 243 ? (via ssh)
psd p
 ERROR: Cannot find XDG_RUNTIME_DIR which should be set by systemd.

it's likely this was true before, through ssh!
in xfce4-terminal:
$ echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
/run/user/1000

------
/proc/pressure/cpu has only some , not a full line?! mkay

-----
//test if crashdump sysrq+c works with zram on!
//nope!!! it tries to enter emergency shell and at the same time save the dump, so if you press Enter it will kill the dumper! because the root password was incorrect while trying to run the emergency shell!
//nvmFIXME: make zram work? or make it use tmpfs instead!
//done by adding kernel arg fstab=no to kdump kernel! it uses tmpfs now

find out how to fix `cd -P .`, which I used in a function cd() in ~/.second.bashrc, to act like `cd .`

enable schedutil on i87k:

ok so, in /etc/default/tlp on i87k:
1. comment out the two CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC which are for intel_pstate driver (unless I'm missing something! i might be! EPB might be in effect instead! which means this still has effect!)
2. set CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC to schedutil (just above the 1.)

alternative way:
/etc/default/cpupower
governor='schedutil'
perf_bias=0
 thanks: https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoronix-articles/1129957-significant-performance-perf-per-watt-gains-coming-for-intel-cpus-on-linux-schedutil?p=1129988#post1129988

but this will need tlp stuff in way1 above to be disabled/unset!

Maybe this is also needed? kernel arg:
intel_pstate=passive
to have schedutil as available governor:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors

hwaccel was disabled in chromium, and I was watching a youtube video at the time while ./0 in firefox with a previously just removed makepkg_pacman dir, which means it has to recreate it! there's no trace of it now after boot, as if it wasn't ever created, as if ./0 never ran

new crash: https://gist.github.com/howaboutsynergy/a18891c58fca76efe954880675e9dd9a
but possibly unrelated!

got another crash(without schedutil.patch and zstd52.patch) and this one is related, the sound was on a loop, no keys were working, screen went black! cpu usage high, and nothing got logged in the journal! since I could sysrq+c to manually crash, I've no idea what caused it!!! with linux-stable 5.3.5-gdc073f193b70

another crash, related, and it's only needed to play youtube videos, usually at the beginning of the video! At crash, the sound is on a loop, then video blanks in a few seconds, no sysrq working!(or numlock!), after reboot some files are 0 bytes(thanks btrfs!) with kernel 5.3.0-g4d856f72c10e with schedutil.patch !!! so it's either schedutil! or it's the 5.3 kernel!

been using this for a while,

hopefully fixed by this: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.4-Critical-Scheduler-BF
which is in 5.4-rc7 as per this https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.4-rc7-Released

---------
removed disk performance monitor xfce4-panel plugin due to this issue https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15881
just in case it was the culprit for me when high writes were happening and youtube videos would be stuttering!

maybe bring it back at some point
or maybe try that multiload-ng but it's only on yaourt and it's lots of them
-------

//see if ttl is being honored for ping-ing
//net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl
//maybe it just doesn't have effect in the current session only? but it does after reboot?
//OR for ping it's simply ignored?
//
//actually this is good, what I'm seeing is the ttl from the responder! which should be different than my own(sender)!

on i87k, replace -march=skylake-avx512 with -march=skylake
because it's faster according to: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=icelake-gcc-tuning&num=4

looks like changes are needed only in glibc and linuxgit arch packages!

or maybe not? " However, the problem with these benchmark results is that they might suggest to the uninitiated that AVX-512 is to be avoided if one wants the best possible performance, which is obviously far from the truth."

or maybe yes: "Using the full 512 can cause an additional processor downclock (over the 256 downclock). So careful tuning is required to know which is better for which type of application, and the compilers heuristics will never be perfect (compilers are still not omniscient). "

"Given the similar outcome with Skylake-AVX512, presumably it's due to the AVX-512 usage leading to lower clock frequencies."

commit b31333298087f8ee3559bd62bcbd1638f232cac0 (HEAD)
Date:   Thu Nov 14 08:28:47 2019 -0800

the kernel got my OS bootup speed fixed, see systemd-analyze, by about 7-8 seconds less!
now, after fix, it's like:
$ systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 4.063s (kernel) + 5.800s (userspace) = 9.863s 
graphical.target reached after 5.790s in userspace

previously, userspace was higher, and total was like 18s

kernel stable 5.4.2 is fast, but 5.4.3 is slower by 1 sec
5.4.3:
$ systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 5.055s (kernel) + 6.371s (userspace) = 11.426s 
graphical.target reached after 6.361s in userspace
reinstlaled the same 5.4.2:
$ systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 5.177s (kernel) + 6.194s (userspace) = 11.372s 
graphical.target reached after 6.184s in userspace

well I guess then it's something else now, isn't it!

5.4.3 reinstalled:
$ systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 5.063s (kernel) + 6.190s (userspace) = 11.253s 
graphical.target reached after 6.180s in userspace

^ all these 3 were with LAN cable already plugged in!

try using BMQ scheduler to see the diff in compiling speed:
as per: https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoronix-articles/1150331-torvalds-comments-on-linux-scheduler-woes-pure-garbage?p=1150342#post1150342
bmq is here: https://gitlab.com/alfredchen/linux-bmq/commits/linux-5.4.y-bmq
unsure how to get only the patch out hmm...

also per: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=radeon-gaming-liquorix54&num=1
^ Liquorix kernel uses BFQ
"The Liquorix kernel is the long-standing effort for providing a "better distro kernel" optimized for desktop/multimedia/gaming workloads."

report typo in comment: https://github.com/binary-manu/arch-ansible/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/all/00-default.yaml#L7

actually, this fork is more up to date: https://github.com/jacoblambda/gentoo-role-base/commits/master
--------
Use augeas instead of ansible: (well, maybe not INSTEAD! puppet can use augeas, maybe ansible can too?)
https://augeas.net/tour.html
this uses github certificate, so add exception in firefox if using https.

---------
I think that no sync-ing is happening every 5(or 10) seconds as per fstab, because I've set in /etc/sysctl.d/10_delay_writes.conf :
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=0
#^ that's disabled!!!!!
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=1000
#^ that should be 10sec
otherwise, my sync-ing (aka running '~/bin/sync') wouldn't take 10 seconds to finish syncing, given than hours have passed since last sync.

Currently both are set to 1500 ! else can lose data due to lack of sync, apparently! (03-03-2020)
--------
make the -9999 packages (git)fetch via portage --fetchonly just like it happens for SRC_URI, instead of fetching during src_unpack!!!! therefore it will work with userpriv ( and -userfetch ), else unpack thus git fetch is attempted as user 'portage' which will fail because owner is 'root' and want to keep it as such!

make RAlt+arrows act the same way af LAlt+arrows, in console mode

virtualbox crashes with kernel 5.10+ (not 5.9) unless CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is =n
see:
https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20163#comment:1
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211469
https://bugs.gentoo.org/760102#c9
--------
something's broken in coreutils(even without any of my patches!) md5sum and sha256sum tested whereby it prepends a '\' slash before the checksum if the filename has slash in name(looks like double slash in bash, unless quoted!), like:
# md5sum  ./etc/systemd/system/netctl@ethernet\\x2dstatic.service.d/profile.conf
\0f508c33284068aac47cf3b45281ab2c  ./etc/systemd/system/netctl@ethernet\\x2dstatic.service.d/profile.conf

ok so:
$ touch \\
$ md5sum \\

find out why ping on a 0.0.0.0 host from /etc/hosts like firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com will actually ping 127.0.0.1

so far I've edited the script to insert 'sleep 1' which mitigates the situation, works everytime, so far.
--------
in Gentoo, 'su -' then 'logout' will exit code '1' but 'echo a' first and it's '0', why?
--------
find all my 'grep' usages in scripts and see where I've used \+ or \anything (see man 1 grep) in non-extended more, and maybe even check the extended ones, to see that it actually does what I wanted eg. \+ in basic mode is like + in extended mode  ie. has special meaning.
   Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead  use
       the backslashed versions \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).
--------
on gentoo, probably during compilation of virtualbox 7.0.14, seen this on 'dmesg' after.
[ 3015.835130] process 'release/obj/USBIdDatabaseGenerator/USBIdDatabaseGenerator' started with executable stack

--------
see if virtualbox is sending the checkCount value too when asking for updates from server, because this would be like a cookie or unique (enough) number, to track each client, unless a failed check causes it to increment it.
        <Host enabled="false" channel="1" checkFreqSec="86400" repoUrl="https://update.virtualbox.org" checkCount="0"/>
